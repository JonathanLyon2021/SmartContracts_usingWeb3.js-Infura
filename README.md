# SmartContracts_usingWeb3.js-Infura
This is Exercise 15 in MI4 of Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program

# Overview
Web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using an HTTP
or IPC connection. In this exercise, we will use web3.js to deploy a contract on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet and
play with it. We will first compile a contract, deploy it and finally call some of the contract’s functions. In order for
web3 to connect to the Ropsten testnet, we will use Infura.io API as our provider.

# Goals
• Using Web3.js, interface with Ethereum’s Ropsten Network via Infura.io.
• Using Web3.js, call smart contract methods.

# Prerequisites
• NodeJS v16.15.0
• NPM v7.19.1
• Solc v0.8.13
• Web3 v3.0.0-rc.5
